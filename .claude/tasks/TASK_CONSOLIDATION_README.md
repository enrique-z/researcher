# Task File Consolidation - README

## Problem Solved
Multiple conflicting task files were causing confusion across different locations with inconsistent priorities and timelines.

## Solution Implemented
Created single master task file consolidating all previous work with strategic corrections.

## Master Task File
**Location**: `/Users/apple/code/Researcher/.claude/tasks/tasks-ursa-universal-pipeline-master.md`

**Key Features**:
- URSA-first experimental priority (corrected from Oxford-first)
- Universal domain-agnostic architecture 
- 4-6 hour realistic timeline leveraging Pipeline 2 foundation
- Clear phase dependencies and acceptance criteria
- Cambridge SAI proof of concept execution plan

## Archived Files (Keep for Reference)
1. `/PIPELINE_2_DEVELOPMENT/tasks/tasks-ai-research-integration.md`
   - 738 lines, 33 tasks, 8 weeks timeline
   - **Use**: Reference for detailed acceptance criteria
   
2. `/PIPELINE_2_DEVELOPMENT/tasks/AI_Research_Integration_PRD.md`
   - 713 lines, comprehensive requirements
   - **Use**: Technical specifications reference
   
3. `/.claude/tasks/tasks-ultimate-pipeline-research.md`
   - 516 lines, 3-4 hour timeline, 80% completion insight
   - **Use**: Foundation for master file structure

## Going Forward
- **Single Source of Truth**: Use only `tasks-ursa-universal-pipeline-master.md`
- **No More Fragmentation**: All updates go to master file
- **Clear Execution Path**: Follow master file phases sequentially

## Strategic Corrections Made
1. **URSA Priority**: Scientific execution capability prioritized over literature retrieval
2. **Universal Architecture**: Domain-agnostic design for any research topic  
3. **Realistic Timeline**: 4-6 hours vs 8+ weeks
4. **Pipeline 2 Leverage**: Use existing 80% complete infrastructure
5. **Future Vision**: Expandable beyond climate research
