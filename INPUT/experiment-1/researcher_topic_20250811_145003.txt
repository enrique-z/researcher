Active Spectroscopy Framework for Stratospheric Aerosol Injection: Information-Theoretic System Identification and Robust Control Design

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: Active Spectroscopy of the Climate: Learning Frequency-Domain Response to Pulsed SAI for Control and Early-Warning

CORE HYPOTHESIS: Small-amplitude, information-optimized pulsed SAI (multi-sine/PRBS/chirp) can be used as active probes in Earth system models to identify frequency-dependent gains, lags, and nonlinear distortions in the climate response. This yields compact, generalizable surrogate models for control design and provides early-warning indicators (phase drift, harmonic growth) of instability that outperform passive, continuous-injection baselines. Frequency-domain system identification under designed perturbations is the most direct and data-efficient way to answer how temporal modulation changes outcomes; simpler passive observation or one-off impulses cannot recover the same spectral and nonlinear structure.

COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK:
We propose an active-sensing framework for stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) that uses small-amplitude, information-optimized pulsed injections to learn the climate system’s frequency-domain response and nonlinear distortions. Rather than comparing continuous versus pulsed schedules in aggregate, we design micro-perturbations—multi-sine, chirp, and pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS)—superimposed on a baseline SAI scenario within Earth system models. From these experiments we estimate compact surrogate models: (i) frequency response (Bode gain/phase) from injection rate to key outputs (global mean temperature, regional precipitation indices, circulation metrics), (ii) low-order Volterra kernels capturing nonlinear harmonics and cross-frequency coupling, and (iii) Koopman-regressed linear predictors for model predictive control (MPC). We then synthesize robust controllers (H-infinity/MPC) that exploit identified dynamics to trade off mean temperature tracking against regional hydrological stability, benchmarking against continuous and naive pulsed baselines. Finally, we develop early-warning indicators based on phase lag drift and harmonic distortion growth under gradually increased forcing, testing their ability to detect approaching instabilities faster than passive variance/autocorrelation metrics. The approach reframes pulsing as purposeful spectroscopy: a minimally invasive, high-information experiment that reveals temporal pathways by which SAI affects coupled climate variables. All experiments are feasible with academic resources using existing models at moderate resolution and standard ML toolkits. Expected outcomes include new insights into optimal temporal modulation, generalizable surrogate dynamics for controllers, and actionable early-warning signals for risk-aware SAI governance.

DETAILED EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL:
- E1. Active probing design and identifiability: In an intermediate-complexity model with interactive stratospheric aerosols, apply small-amplitude multi-sine injections (0.05–0.5 TgS/yr RMS) around a steady baseline (e.g., 5 TgS/yr). Frequencies: monthly to interannual (0.02–2 cycles/year). Optimize phases/amplitudes by maximizing Fisher information under variance/ozone constraints. Outputs: global mean surface temperature (GMST), Sahel/JJA precipitation, monsoon indices, QBO/strat winds, SAOD. Metrics: SNR, parameter covariance, recovered transfer function smoothness (L-curve).
- E2. Frequency response and nonlinear distortion: Estimate Bode gain/phase via spectral regression with leakage correction. Fit 2nd-order Volterra kernels via sparsity (lasso/elastic net on polynomial-convolution features) to capture harmonic generation and intermodulation. Validate on held-out single-tone tests; metrics: normalized RMSE, coherence, harmonic distortion index (HDI), cross-frequency prediction error.
- E3. Robust control synthesis: Using identified models, design H-infinity and MPC controllers that track GMST to a target while constraining regional precipitation variance and limiting SAOD excursions. Compare to continuous and naive square-wave pulsing under ENSO-like stochastic variability and an exogenous volcanic eruption scenario. Metrics: tracking RMSE, constraint violation rate, controller effort (TV norm), worst-case regional anomaly, and regret versus an oracle that knows the true model.
- E4. Early-warning via phase drift and harmonic growth: Gradually increase baseline forcing (e.g., escalating SAI to offset extreme warming) and monitor changes in estimated phase lag and HDI across bands. Hypothesis: approaching instabilities show phase drift toward -π and rising HDI. Compare detection lead time and AUC with passive early-warning metrics (variance, lag-1 autocorrelation).
- E5. Cross-model robustness: Repeat E1–E4 in two tiers: (a) an idealized aquaplanet or EMIC and (b) a coarser-resolution ESM with stratospheric chemistry (e.g., CESM-like). Transfer identified controllers across models without retraining. Metrics: cross-model generalization error, controller robustness margins, failure modes analysis.
- E6. Practicality bounds: Trade-offs between probe amplitude, duration, and identifiability under internal variability. Vary probe amplitude (0.02–0.5 TgS/yr), experiment length (5–30 years), and ensemble size. Metrics: Fisher information growth, estimation bias/variance, computational cost, and minimal experimental design achieving target prediction error.
