QBO Phase-Locked Stratospheric Aerosol Injection: A Cambridge Proof of Concept Study

This research investigates the potential for enhancing stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) geoengineering effectiveness by synchronizing aerosol deployment with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) phase. The QBO is a quasi-periodic oscillation of the equatorial zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere that alternates between easterly and westerly phases approximately every 28 months.

HYPOTHESIS: Timing stratospheric aerosol injection to coincide with specific QBO phases can significantly enhance cooling efficiency while reducing adverse side effects, particularly ozone depletion and regional precipitation pattern disruption.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:
1. Characterize the relationship between QBO phase and stratospheric circulation patterns
2. Model aerosol transport and dispersion efficiency during different QBO phases
3. Quantify the radiative forcing enhancement potential of phase-locked injection
4. Assess the impact on ozone chemistry and atmospheric circulation
5. Evaluate the feasibility and controllability of phase-dependent injection strategies
6. Develop risk assessment framework for QBO-SAI implementation

KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. How does QBO phase affect stratospheric aerosol transport and residence time?
2. What is the optimal injection timing relative to QBO phase transitions?
3. Can phase-locked SAI achieve equivalent cooling with reduced aerosol loading?
4. What are the differential impacts on ozone depletion during easterly vs westerly phases?
5. How does QBO-SAI coupling affect regional climate patterns and extreme weather?
6. What are the predictability and control challenges for operational implementation?

METHODOLOGY:
- General circulation modeling with coupled chemistry-climate models
- Historical QBO phase analysis and stratospheric circulation characterization  
- Aerosol microphysics and transport modeling
- Radiative forcing calculations and climate response simulation
- Statistical analysis of phase-dependent outcomes
- Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis
- Risk assessment and impact evaluation

EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE:
This research addresses a critical gap in geoengineering science by exploring temporal optimization strategies for SAI deployment. If successful, QBO phase-locking could enable more efficient and controlled solar radiation management with reduced environmental risks. The Cambridge proof of concept will provide foundational evidence for advanced geoengineering governance and implementation frameworks.

The study contributes to three key areas:
1. Enhanced scientific understanding of QBO-stratosphere-aerosol interactions
2. Practical geoengineering deployment optimization strategies  
3. Risk reduction frameworks for responsible solar radiation management research

CAMBRIDGE COLLABORATION:
This proof of concept study is conducted in collaboration with Cambridge atmospheric physics research groups, leveraging their expertise in stratospheric dynamics, aerosol chemistry, and climate modeling. The research aims to establish Cambridge as a leading center for responsible geoengineering research and governance.
