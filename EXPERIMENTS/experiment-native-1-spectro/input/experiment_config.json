  "core_hypothesis": "Small-amplitude, information-optimized pulsed SAI (multi-sine/PRBS/chirp) can be used as active probes in Earth system models to identify frequency-dependent gains, lags, and nonlinear distortions in the climate response. This yields compact, generalizable surrogate models for control design and provides early-warning indicators (phase drift, harmonic growth) of instability that outperform passive, continuous-injection baselines. Frequency-domain system identification under designed perturbations is the most direct and data-efficient way to answer how temporal modulation changes outcomes; simpler passive observation or one-off impulses cannot recover the same spectral and nonlinear structure.",
