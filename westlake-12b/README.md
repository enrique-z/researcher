## Model Info

The CycleResearcher model series includes two main variants:

1. **ML Series**: Specifically trained for machine learning research, including computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and multimedia (MM)
2. **Science Series**: Extended to broader scientific domains (Coming soon)

All models have undergone extensive training on our Research-8k dataset and are optimized using the CycleReviewer feedback loop. According to our license, **all models and their derivatives cannot be used for generating papers without proper disclosure of AI assistance.** We also provide FastDetectGPT-based tools to detect potential misuse of these models.

**Model Release Date**: October 2024  
**Knowledge Cutoff Date**: October 2024

### Open Source License

The code in this repository is open-sourced under the Apache-2.0 license. The model weights are open-sourced under the CycleResearcher-License.

### Detecting misuse of CycleResearcher 

To ensure the responsible use of our models, we implemented the Fast-DetectGPT method to classify whether a paper is machine-generated. Detection performance comparison across different formats. The human samples are from the test sets of Research-8k and Reviewer-5k.

## Quick Start

### Using Transformers

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Initialize model
model_name = "WestlakeNLP/CycleResearcher-12B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto",
    max_memory={i: "24GiB" for i in range(torch.cuda.device_count())},
)

# Generation parameters
generation_config = {
    "max_length": 19000,
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "pad_token_id": None,
    "do_sample": True,
}

# Prepare system prompt and input
system_prompt = """You are a research assistant AI tasked with generating a scientific paper based on provided literature. Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given References. 
2. Identify gaps in existing research to establish the motivation for a new study.
3. Propose a main idea for a new research work.
4. Write the paper's main content in LaTeX format, including:
 - Title
 - Abstract
 - Introduction
 - Related Work
 - Methods/
5. Generate experimental setup details in JSON format to guide researchers.
6. After receiving experimental results in JSON format, analyze them.
7. Complete the paper by writing:
 - Results
 - Discussion
 - Conclusion
 - Contributions
Ensure all content is original, academically rigorous, and follows standard scientific writing conventions."""

# Reference input should be in BibTeX format
references = """@article{Qiu2020PretrainedMF,

"""

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    {"role": "user", "content": references}
]

# Generate paper
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, **generation_config)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### Using VLLM (Recommended for faster inference)

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

# Initialize model with VLLM
model = LLM(
    model="WestlakeNLP/CycleResearcher-12B",
    tensor_parallel_size=8,
    max_model_len=15000,
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.95,
)

# Generation parameters
sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.4,
    top_p=0.95,
    max_tokens=4096
)

# Generate paper
outputs = model.generate([prompt], sampling_params)
```

## Input Data Format

CycleResearcher expects reference input in BibTeX format with abstracts. Example format:

```bibtex
@article{example2023,
    title = {Sample Paper Title},
    author = {Author, A. and Author, B.},
    journal = {Journal Name},
    year = {2024},
    abstract = {This is a sample abstract that provides context...}
}

Abstract: This is a sample abstract that provides context...
@article{example2024,
    title = {Sample Paper Title},
    author = {Author, A. and Author, B.},
    journal = {Journal Name},
    year = {2024},
}
```

## Output Format

The model generates output with the following structure:

```python
{
    'title': 'Paper title',
    'abstract': 'Paper abstract',
    'latex': 'Main paper content in LaTeX format',
    'motivation': 'Research motivation',
    'idea': 'Main research idea',
    'Experimental_Setup': 'Experiment configuration (JSON/text)',
    'Experimental_results': 'Results and findings (JSON/text)',
    'generated_text': 'Complete raw generated text'
}
```
